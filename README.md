# Beta Test site for DataRyot's features
unfortunately written in R

Running on small instances on ShinyApps.io:
     https://pirawna.shinyapps.io/repeatPurchase/ (10 MB)
     https://pirawna.shinyapps.io/repeatPurchase2/ (200 MB)
     https://pirawna1.shinyapps.io/repeatPurchase/ (200 MB)

Note ShinyApps.io has a limit of 25 user hours per month, this will limit the tools ability to become an integral monthly workflow 



Also running on Ploomber.io:
    https://autumn-recipe-5460.ploomberapp.io/

This should have no limit on memory, only cpu. But as far as I can tell it's much faster than shinyapps.io
